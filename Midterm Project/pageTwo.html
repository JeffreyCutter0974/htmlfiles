                <p>When developing video games there is a lot of creativity that must be involved.  You must be able to draw the idea on paper, add sounds to it, be able to write a computer program and then test and package the video games before they can be sold(MH.com).  Most video games are also made with parental controls on them so that parents have the final say in how much content their child is exposed to or even how much time they play(Source #2).

                <p>These limits may be necessary because over half of the top 50 video games contain violence.  It is also reported that 97% of 12-17 year olds report playing video games(Source #4).  Not all video games are just for fun or have violent effects.  There are companies that develop video games to teach the employees important skills related to the job (Source #5). So, playing video games can enhance your job performance.

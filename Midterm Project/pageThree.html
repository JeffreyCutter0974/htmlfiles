                <p>various shootings being linked to violent video games, many are concerned about the amount of violence in each video game.  The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has developed a rating system.  When games are sold they are rated by the ESRB.   “The ESRB is a non-profit self regulatory body that assigns ratings to video games and apps so parents can make informed choices”(Source #2).  This rating system is widely adopted by game platforms and is described by parents as the best entertainment rating system in the US(Source #2).  There is some concern about the amount of violence in each video game and The American Psychological Association tried to get the video industry to reduce the violence in games for youth.  In 2005, Hillary Clinton tried to pass a law making it illegal to sell “mature” or “adult only” games to minors.  This bill never made it out of committee(Source #4).

                <p>Playing violent video games seems to result in negative consequences, while playing action video games has been shown to be beneficial.  It seems like monitoring and time limits are good to incorporate when playing video games.  Video games are here to stay so it is up to each individual to make sure the games being played and the time being spent is positive.

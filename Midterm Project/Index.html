                <p>Video games are developed by different companies and organizations.  Before video games were made, people played pinball machines in arcades.  Pinball machines were invented in the 1930s and remained popular until the 1970s(Source #1).  Video games have evolved from the arcade to home playing systems to games played on the computer.  One of the early popular playing systems was Atari.  In 1976, Atari was sold to Warner Communications for 28 million dollars.  This was the beginning of having a variety of video games in your home to play at anytime(Source #1).  Two companies joined together in 1983 to create Pac-man.  It is still one of the most popular video games today(Source #1).  As personal computers became more widely available games were created for computers(Source #1).  In 1995, DVDs for computers were developed and since they could store up to twenty times more than CD-ROMS this was another big step in computer gaming(Source #1).  With the internet and online gaming, video games can now be played without a cartridge, DVD or CD-ROM.
